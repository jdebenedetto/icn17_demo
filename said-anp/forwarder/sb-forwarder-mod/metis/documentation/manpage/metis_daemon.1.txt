DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       mmeettiiss__ddaaeemmoonn  is  the CCNx 1.0 forwarder, which runs on each end system
       and as a software forwarder on intermediate systems.   metis_daemon  is
       the  program  to  launch  Metis, either as a console program or a back‐
       ground daemon (detatched from console).  Once running, use the  program
       mmeettiiss__ccoonnttrrooll to configure Metis.


       Metis is structured as a set of Listeners, each of which handles a spe‐
       cific method of listening for packets.  For  example,  a  TCP  listener
       will  accept  connections on a specific TCP port on a specific local IP
       address.  An Ethernet listener will accept frames of a specific  Ether‐
       Type on a specific Interface.


       When  Metis  accepts a connection, it will create a Connection entry in
       the ConnectionTable to represent that peer.  For Ethernet, a Connection
       is the tuple {dmac, smac, ethertype}.  For TCP and UDP, it is the tuple
       {source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port}.  The connid
       (connection ID) becomes the reverse route index in the Pending Interest
       Table.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --config _c_o_n_f_i_g_f_i_l_e
                 Reads configuration parameters from _c_o_n_f_i_g_f_i_l_e.   The  _-_-_p_o_r_t
                 option  has  no effect in this mode and Metis will not listen
                 to any ports.  This means that mmeettiiss__ccoonnttrrooll will not be able
                 to  connect  to  Metis  to  configure  it  further unless one
                 includes at least a listener for  TCP  localhost  or  a  unix
                 domain socket.


       --capacity _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_S_t_o_r_e_S_i_z_e
                 Sets  the  capacity  of the Content Store to _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_S_t_o_r_e_S_i_z_e
                 content objects.  Metis uses a  least-recently-used  eviction
                 policy.  A size of 0 will disable the Content Store.


                 The  Content Store sits on the fast path of the forwarder, so
                 there is a cost associated with adding and removing items  to
                 the Content Store tables.


       --daemon  Runs  Metis  in  daemon mode, detaching from the console.  It
                 must be run with the _-_-_l_o_g_-_f_i_l_e option.


       --log _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y=_l_e_v_e_l
                 Sets the log level of the given  _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y             to  the
                 given  _l_e_v_e_l.  The _-_-_l_o_g option may be repeated several times
                 setting the log level of different facilities.  If  the  same
                 facility  is  listed  twice,  only  the  last occurance takes
                 effect.  The default log level is Error for all facilities.


                 Facilities:

                    ·  all: All facilities.


                    ·  config: Configuration activies.


                    ·  core: Core forwarder, such as startup and shutdown.


                    ·  io: Listeners, connections, and all I/O related activi‐
                       ties.


                    ·  message: CCNx messages, such as parsing.


                    ·  processor:  Forwarding  processor, such as CS, FIB, and
                       PIT activities.



                 The log levels are:  debug,  info,  notice,  warning,  error,
                 critical, alert, off.


       --log-file _l_o_g_f_i_l_e
                 Specifies  the _l_o_g_f_i_l_e             to write all log messages.
                 This parameter is required with _-_-_d_a_e_m_o_n mode.


       --port _p_o_r_t
                 The UDP  and  TCP  port  to  listen  on.   If  no  _c_o_n_f_i_g_f_i_l_e
                 is  specified,  Metis  will listen on this port on all inter‐
                 faces including localhost.


                 If this parameter is not given, Metis uses the  default  port
                 9695.

          ·  A given interface may only have  one  Ethernet  listener  on  one
             EtherType.


          ·  If  there are multiple longest matching prefix entries that match
             an Interest, it will be forwarded to all those routes (i.e.  mul‐
             ticast).


          ·  Ethernet  fragmentation will only use the interface MTU and there
             is not MTU discovery.  If Metis is used in a bridged environment,
             this may lead to errors if the MTU changes on different segments,
             such as a 10G link at 9000 bytes and a  100  Mbps  link  at  1500
             bytes.

          ·  Adding the same listener twice will cause Metis to crash.


          ·  Errors in the configuration file may cause Metis to crash.


          ·  The  command  'list  connections' will display all connections as
             TCP encapsulation.
