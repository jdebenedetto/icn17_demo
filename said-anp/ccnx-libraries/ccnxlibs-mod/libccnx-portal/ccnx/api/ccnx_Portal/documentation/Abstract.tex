\Abstract{
The CCN Transport Stack is a software framework that provides facilities for orchestrating the transmission and reception of CCN messages.
The design of the Transport Stack permits a high degree of configurability enabling different capabilities and behaviors as needed. The CCN Portal API is a programmatic mechanism to create, maintain and use multiple CCN Transport Stacks, each associated with a specific Portal instance.
Each CCN Portal instance provides a simple programming interface to an associated CCN Transport Stack.
